Temporary workaround to get the annotation data from the tagging tool:

- Open an annotation which has finished findings and segments
- Open the dev console (F12 or right click, inspect in chrome)
- Click “Console”
- At the top, click “default levels”, and select Verbose
- In the filter box, paste “FrameVideoView: CDU:”
- On the latest log entry, right click the first of the two objects and select “Store as global variable”
- The findings and segments will then be available in a variable called “temp1” in the dev console. If you want, you can use JSON.stringify(temp1) to make a string of the object, and copy that into your editor of choice.
- Findings will be in the field “videoFindings”, and segments in “videoSegments”
