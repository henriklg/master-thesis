  abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3\% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5\% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0\% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80\% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3\%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60\% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined effects of health maintenance organization (HMO) penetration, hospital competition, and patient severity on the uptake of laparoscopic colectomy and its price relative to open surgery for colon cancer. METHODS: The MarketScan Database (data from 2002-2007) was used to identify admissions for privately insured colorectal cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic or open partial colectomy (n = 1035 and n = 6389, respectively). Patient and health plan characteristics were retrieved from these data; HMO market penetration rates and an index of hospital market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), were derived from national databases. Logistic and logarithmic regressions were used to examine the odds of having laparoscopic colectomy, effect of covariates on colectomy prices, and the differential price of laparoscopy. RESULTS: Adoption of laparoscopy was highly sensitive to market forces, with a 10\% increase in HMO penetration leading to a 10.9\% increase in the likelihood of undergoing laparoscopic colectomy (adjusted odds ratio = 1.109; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.062, 1.158) and a 10\% increase in HHI resulting in 6.6\% lower likelihood (adjusted odds ratio = 0.936; 95\% CI = 0.880, 0.996). Price models indicated that the price of laparoscopy was 7.6\% lower than that of open surgery (transformed coefficient = 0.927; 95\% CI = 0.895, 0.960). A 10\% increase in HMO penetration was associated with 1.6\% lower price (transformed coefficient = 0.985; 95\% CI = 0.977, 0.992), whereas a 10\% increase in HHI was associated with 1.6\% higher price (transformed coefficient = 1.016; 95\% CI = 1.006, 1.027; P {$<$} .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy was significantly associated with lower hospital prices. Moreover, laparoscopic surgery may result in cost savings, while market pressures contribute to its adoption.

  title = {Computer-{{Aided Screening}} of {{Capsule Endoscopy Videos}}},
  abstract = {Colon cancer accounts for almost 10\% of all cancer cases worldwide. It is also the fourth most common cause of death from cancer globally. However, many cases of colon cancer could be prevented by early screening and removal of colon polyps - a common precursor of colon cancer. In this respect, capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive screening method with the potential to significantly reduce the cost of screening as well as the discomfort caused for the patient using traditional endoscopy examination. The financial cost of evaluating the recorded video footage, as well as the availability of specialists, currently prevents the deployment of capsule endoscopy for mass screening. With this work, we research solutions for automating the evaluation of capsule endoscopy video sequences using machine learning, image recognition and extraction of global image features. Rather than focusing on a single approach, we build tools that can be used for conducting further experiments with different methods and algorithms. We present the prototype of an integrated software solution that can be used for collecting videos from hospitals, annotating videos, tracking objects in video sequences, build- ing training and testing datasets, training classifiers and eventually, testing and evaluating the generated classifiers. We evaluate our software by training classifiers that are based on three different image recognition approaches. We also test the generated classifiers with different datasets and thereby evaluate the different approaches for their feasibility of being used to recognize colon polyps. Our main conclusion is that state of the art image recognition methods, such as the use of Haar- features or Histogram of oriented Gradients based detectors, are not suitable for detecting lesions in the intestine because of the enormous variety of possible appearances and orientations of such lesions. Global image features such as Joint Composite Descriptor on the other hand, lead to very promising results. Performing leave-one-out-cross-validation with all 20 videos of the ASU-Mayo Clinic polyp database, our system achieves a weighted average precision of 93.9\% and a weighted average recall of 98.5\%.},

  abstract = {Tracking of moving objects in real situation is a challenging research issue, due to dynamic changes in objects or background appearance, illumination, shape and occlusions. In this paper, we deal with these difficulties by incorporating an adaptive feature weighting mechanism to the proposed growing competitive neural network for multiple objects tracking. The neural network takes advantage of the most relevant object features (information provided by the proposed adaptive feature weighting mechanism) in order to estimate the trajectories of the moving objects. The feature selection mechanism is based on a genetic algorithm, and the tracking algorithm is based on a growing competitive neural network where each unit is associated to each object in the scene. The proposed methods (object tracking and feature selection mechanism) are applied to detect the trajectories of moving vehicles in roads. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed system compared to the standard Kalman filter.},

  abstract = {Object tracking has been one of the most important and active research areas in the field of computer vision. A large number of tracking algorithms have been proposed in recent years with demonstrated success. However, the set of sequences used for evaluation is often not sufficient or is sometimes biased for certain types of algorithms. Many datasets do not have common ground-truth object positions or extents, and this makes comparisons among the reported quantitative results difficult. In addition, the initial conditions or parameters of the evaluated tracking algorithms are not the same, and thus, the quantitative results reported in literature are incomparable or sometimes contradictory. To address these issues, we carry out an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art online object-tracking algorithms with various evaluation criteria to understand how these methods perform within the same framework. In this work, we first construct a large dataset with ground-truth object positions and extents for tracking and introduce the sequence attributes for the performance analysis. Second, we integrate most of the publicly available trackers into one code library with uniform input and output formats to facilitate large-scale performance evaluation. Third, we extensively evaluate the performance of 31 algorithms on 100 sequences with different initialization settings. By analyzing the quantitative results, we identify effective approaches for robust tracking and provide potential future research directions in this field.},
