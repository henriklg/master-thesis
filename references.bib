  abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3\% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5\% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0\% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80\% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3\%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60\% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined effects of health maintenance organization (HMO) penetration, hospital competition, and patient severity on the uptake of laparoscopic colectomy and its price relative to open surgery for colon cancer. METHODS: The MarketScan Database (data from 2002-2007) was used to identify admissions for privately insured colorectal cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic or open partial colectomy (n = 1035 and n = 6389, respectively). Patient and health plan characteristics were retrieved from these data; HMO market penetration rates and an index of hospital market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), were derived from national databases. Logistic and logarithmic regressions were used to examine the odds of having laparoscopic colectomy, effect of covariates on colectomy prices, and the differential price of laparoscopy. RESULTS: Adoption of laparoscopy was highly sensitive to market forces, with a 10\% increase in HMO penetration leading to a 10.9\% increase in the likelihood of undergoing laparoscopic colectomy (adjusted odds ratio = 1.109; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.062, 1.158) and a 10\% increase in HHI resulting in 6.6\% lower likelihood (adjusted odds ratio = 0.936; 95\% CI = 0.880, 0.996). Price models indicated that the price of laparoscopy was 7.6\% lower than that of open surgery (transformed coefficient = 0.927; 95\% CI = 0.895, 0.960). A 10\% increase in HMO penetration was associated with 1.6\% lower price (transformed coefficient = 0.985; 95\% CI = 0.977, 0.992), whereas a 10\% increase in HHI was associated with 1.6\% higher price (transformed coefficient = 1.016; 95\% CI = 1.006, 1.027; P {$<$} .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy was significantly associated with lower hospital prices. Moreover, laparoscopic surgery may result in cost savings, while market pressures contribute to its adoption.
